IDEAL for Chapter 3

Due to time running out, the IDEAL process was practically the same for all the problems.

I - Create the stack and queue class for operations
D - Try and hard code the pop, push, peek, isEmpty, and other methods for operations for stacks and queues
E, A - Code creation was just using the created classes from the first question done by me, but when the last question was done, I was able to finally use the libraries.
L - I learned that hardcoding classes of structures can actually benefit you because if you get a problem in an interview,
    and it is related to these that we have done in classes or in this assignment, you can remember how to utlize and create them from
    scratch again. Everything becomes beneficial in the long run.
